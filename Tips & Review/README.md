Tips & Review
=============

This page consists of any topics from CPSC 120 or about the class that I (or any other minds) 
consider useful to know for this class and beyond. Click the links above for more information.

My previous SI repositories can be accessed by checking the listings located on 
[my GitHub profile page](http://www.github.com/joegreene). One was from my 120 SI in Spring 2014, 
and the other was from my 121 SI in Fall 2014.
