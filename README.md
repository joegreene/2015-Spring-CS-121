2015-Spring-CS-121
==================

Work used during the SI portion of the Spring 2015 CPSC 121 Class, Section 15/16, TuTh 8:30 - 9:20AM with Professor Frick.


__Meeting Times__: 
- Tuesdays: 2:30PM - 3:30PM @ University Learning Center (2nd Floor, North Pollak Library, Tutoring Center Area*

*To be specific, the SI will be located at the tables near the windows (farthest down, east side). You'll see me there a good ten minutes 
prior to the session.

__Extra Information__:
- If you would like review on CS 120 topics, take a look at the References folder above. It covers most (if not all) 
possible review of the material you've worked on in CS 120 (that is, if you took that class at CSUF). The Weekly Work 
folder includes all the work done at each SI session each week throughout the Fall 2014 semester.
- If you need to contact me, my email is located at the bottom of this page (and all other pages in this repository). I can also 
be contacted after class (I normally sit in the back, far left). 

I look forward to working with you guys this semester!


__NOTE__: Most (if not all) updates to this repository are done between Friday evening and Saturday morning. If you've come 
to check for updates on the weekly work, best time to check it out is Saturday.
