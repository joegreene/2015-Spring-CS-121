2015-Spring-CS-121
==================

Work used during the SI portion of the Spring 2015 CPSC 121 Class, Section 15, TuTh 8:30 - 9:20AM with Professor Frick.


__Meeting Times__: 
- Tuesdays: 10:00 - 11:00 AM @ CS 110A (this is a standard lecture room)
- Wednesdays: 8:50 - 9:50 AM @ CS 300* (this is a lab room)

 * More likely than not, I'll be in the room by 8:15 AM. If you notice me in there, come in as the door should be already open.

__Extra Information__:
- The "Tips & Review" folder, as you may have guessed, hosts various information that may serve helpful to you within this course 
(and later on). Currently I've been having trouble finding time to add more to it, so best thing to do (if you want to see tips/review) is to check the weekly work folders.
- If you need to contact me my email is located at the bottom of this page (and all other pages in this repository). I can also be contacted after class (I normally sit in the back, far left). You can ask me any questions regarding the material.

I look forward to working with you guys this semester!


__NOTE__: Most (if not all) updates to this repository are done between Thursday evening and Friday evening. If you've come to check for updates on the weekly work, this means that the best time to check it out is either midday Friday (or if I'm really lagging, Saturday).
