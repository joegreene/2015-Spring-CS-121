2015-Spring-CS-121
==================

Work used during the SI portion of the Spring 2015 CPSC 121 Class, Section 15, TuTh 8:30 - 9:20AM with Professor Frick.


__Meeting Times__: 
- Tuesdays: 10:00 - 11:00 AM @ CS 110A
- Wednesdays: 8:50 - 9:50 AM @ CS 300*

* More likely than not, the room will be open from 8 AM and onwards, meaning I might be there before the session 
actually starts. If you notice me in there, you can either knock on the door or come in as the door might already be 
open.

__Extra Information__:
- The "Tips & Review" folder, as you may have guessed, hosts various information that may serve helpful to you within this course 
(and later on). I'm continually updating it with information whenever I come across some.
- If you need to contact me, my email is located at the bottom of this page (and all other pages in this repository). I can also 
be contacted after class (I normally sit in the back, far left).

I look forward to working with you guys this semester!


__NOTE__: Most (if not all) updates to this repository are done between Thursday evening and Friday evening. If you've come 
to check for updates on the weekly work, best time to check it out is either midday Friday (or if I'm really lagging, Saturday).
