### Intro

Since both lectures this week were reserved for the exam, there wasn't much done in either SI Session for this week. 
As we only talked about the exam, and as I do not believe I can discuss anything about the exam on here, there are 
no notes for this week.

Another note: I don't know what will be on the second portion of the exam. My guess is that it will be a free-response 
section, where you will have to make your own functions and program given specifications (similar to myprogramminglab 
I'd guess).

Check out last week's work if you want a recap on other stuff.

This hosts the activities we worked on during the SI class on Tuesday and Wednesday, 3/17 & 3/18.
