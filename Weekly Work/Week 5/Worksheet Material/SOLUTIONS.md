# Week 5 Solutions

### Intro
This hosts the solutions to the worksheet set for this week's SI session.

### Questions
For the actual prompts, look at the worksheet file (the .docx file in the file listing above).

If you downloaded the worksheet file before today, I've made edits to it.

Anyway, you may refer to [here](https://github.com/joegreene/CS_121_Fall_2014/tree/master/Weekly%20Work/Week%205/Resources)
for some pseudo-code solutions. The worksheet is about the same as my last semester's, minus a few 
changes (such as setting the second prompt to fit in with vectors), but it should suffice.

We only worked on the second one in the session, and peers asked for a C++ example of how the solution 
may look like, so I've provided one in the file listing above (labeled `palindrome_solution.cpp`).

On top of that, I've also posted a solution which doesn't store the string (which is much shorter and more 
efficient). This is in the `palindrome_alt_solution.cpp` file.

As I try to emphasize every time when working with code: __There are many ways to solve a problem__. My 
solutions might not always be the best, but I write them the way I do here to explain the concept.
