### Intro
This hosts the solutions to the worksheet set for this week's SI session.

__There are many ways to solve a problem__. 
My solutions might not always be the most efficient, however I write my solutions in a way to 
explain concepts and to allow others to optimize them however they wish.

### Questions
For the prompt, look at the worksheet file (the .docx file in the file listing above).

If you downloaded the worksheet file before today, I've made edits to it recently. I removed the 
first prompt since we ignored it completely in the session.

Anyways, you may refer to [here](https://github.com/joegreene/CS_121_Fall_2014/tree/master/Weekly%20Work/Week%205/Resources)
for the pseudo-code solution. Specifically, refer to the second solution.

Peers asked for a C++ example of how the solution 
may look like, so I've provided one in the file listing labelled `palindrome_solution.cpp` located in the file listing of the previous page or
[here](https://github.com/joegreene/2015-Spring-CS-121/blob/master/Weekly%20Work/Week%205/Worksheet%20Material/palindrome_solution.cpp).

On top of that, I've also posted a solution which doesn't store the string (which is shorter and more 
efficient). This is in the `palindrome_alt_solution.cpp` file in the listing of the previous page or 
[here](https://github.com/joegreene/2015-Spring-CS-121/blob/master/Weekly%20Work/Week%205/Worksheet%20Material/palindrome_alt_solution.cpp).
